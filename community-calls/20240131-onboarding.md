##Â Debrief

* Following up on using Github workshop: seems like there's a regular need for those workshops
* Onboarding call linked to Github workshop: maybe not the case every time: but planned for a more regular basis?
* Github sessions are usually done ad-hoc to bookdash, and with carpentry-con
    * [https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/issues/2556](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/issues/2556) - sample issue
    * [https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/issues/3006](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/issues/3006)
    * [https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/issues/3007](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/issues/3007)
* Make a pool for people who can facilitate github workshops, maybe a possibility to have a github room?
* introduction should be interactive at the beginning, allow for around 15 to 20min ay yhe beginning
    * asking people 'what would a successful call look like for you'? or 'why are you joining' or 'what do you want to get out of this'
    * people might not know what they what , so its okay to have leeway for the unknown in the call
* music - at the beginning & end of the call is okay! 
* Should these calls be recorded? No - not for now
* Reminder email warked before the call
* follow up email would be good - to participants who signed up
